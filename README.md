# Path Plan Tester

Create a new strategy for getting aligned to the target.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo to you local
2. Create a virtual environment, e.g., `virtualenv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment, e.g., `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now you can run the different strategies, try `python strategy_simple.py` and `python strategy_angle_simple.py` to compare the different paths.
Once setup, you create your own strategies for getting from the starting point to the target, labeled as `tag_pose` and `tag_loc` in the initial state.
